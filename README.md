# Vicente's dev branch

Whenever Vicente updates something, he will do it in this branch, so it will be
merged later via a Pull Request, if everything is working correctly of course. This
readme will work as a explanation point for every important changes, as any
fix/implementation pass to the "common knowledge" of the project, they'll be removed
from this readme so it doesn't get too large. With that said, happy coding!

## v1.0
Nothing done, but it will soon!
