# Source code for the vEzzel project

As everything is part of an university project (or assignment) this repo will work
as a prototype for a posible real project, so eventually it will grow, get better
coded in every way, and of course, it will be private.

This project is being developed with SCRUM, using some JavaScript technologies oriented
to web programming, the purpose of this platform is explained with more detail in
the official site of vEzzel, so visit us there! [https://vezzel.netlify.app/](https://vezzel.netlify.app/)
