# Vicente's dev branch

Whenever Vicente updates something, he will do it in this branch, so it will be
merged later via a Pull Request, if everything is working correctly of course. This
readme will work as an explanation point for every important changes, as any
fix/implementation pass to the "common knowledge" of the project, they'll be removed
from this readme so it doesn't get too large. With that said, happy coding!

## v1.0
The idea is to do 2 components, a Container, that gets some entries in the form of
a table or matrix, and a Vessel that must be a somewhat entry that later on can be
setted as any of the typed cells. Of course just a prototype of them, as it has to
be done in less than 2 days!
